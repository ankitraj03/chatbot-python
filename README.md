Chatbot with PyTorch
Introduction
This project implements a simple chatbot using PyTorch, NLTK, and JSON for intent classification. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents stored in a JSON file and uses a neural network model to classify user input into predefined intents.

Features
Data preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words representation.
Neural network model: Implemented using PyTorch.
Training: The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Multi-class classification: Classifies user input into predefined intents.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NLTK
JSON

sage
Prepare training data:
Create a JSON file (intents.json) containing intents and patterns.
Train the model:
Run the train.py script to train the chatbot model.
Interact with the chatbot:
Use the interact.py script to interact with the trained chatbot.
File Structure
intents.json: Contains intents and patterns for training.
train.py: Script to train the chatbot model.
interact.py: Script to interact with the trained chatbot.
model.py: Defines the neural network model.
nltk_utils.py: Utility functions for data preprocessing.
